## Introduction  
<br/>


Wind energy is one of Ireland's most important renewable resources. Understanding wind patterns helps explore energy potential.  

Galway - Mace Head station is a particularly relevant case study, having received the highest number of wind warnings in Ireland since 2020.  
Over this period, Galway recorded 234 wind warnings, spanning 66 days and 1,603 hours, with maximum wind speeds reaching 145 km/h, highlighting the county’s exposure to frequent and intense wind events.  

The Map Alerter [*article*](https://www.mapalerter.ie/blog/met-eireann-severe-weather-galway-wind-2025) "*Storm Events and Maximum Wind Speeds*" , supports the selection of Galway as the primary study location, demonstrating:  

High frequency of wind events  
Exposure to severe wind conditions  
Relevance for wind energy discussions  

Given my residence in Galway, this study is of particular interest, providing a local perspective on wind energy potential.  

This project examines historical wind data for Galway to identify trends over time, including daily, monthly and seasonal variations, it also explores simple predictions of future wind patterns.  

The methods used in this project can be extended in future work to compare multiple locations across western Ireland or to incorporate more advanced predictive models.

## Project workflow
<br/>



The following workflow outlines the step-by-step process of this project based on the Data Science/Analytics project lifecycle.  

Each step will be addressed in the notebook, with outputs, analysis and commentary as the project progresses:  

- [✔️] **Problem Definition**   
    Define the project goal/scope of analyzing Galway windspeed.  
- [✔️] **Data Collection**  
    Gather historical windspeed data from galway and optionnaly from other selected stations in west ireland for potential comparative purposes.  
- [✔️] **Data Preparation**  
    Handle datasets inconsistencies
- [ ] **Exploratory Data Analysis**  
    Visualize wind speed trends and patterns  
- [ ] **Modeling and Evaluation**  
    Estimate potential turbine power, analyze trends and predict future wind patterns.  
- [ ] **Documentation and Reporting**  
    Record findings, plots and interpretation.
