## Introduction  


Wind energy is one of ireland's most important renewable resources. Understanding wind patterns in Galway helps explore energy potential.  
This project examines historical wind data in Galway to identify trends overtime, including daily, monthly and seasonal variations, and also explores simple predictions of future wind patterns.  
This analysis can later be compared with other locations in West ireland.  

## Project workflow 


The following workflow outlines the step-by-step process of this project based on the Data Science/Analytics project lifecycle.  
Each step will be addressed in the notebook, with outputs, analysis and commentary as the project progresses:  

- [✔️] **Problem Definition**   
    Define the project goal/scope of analyzing Galway windspeed.  
- []  / In progress - **Data Collection**  
    Gather historical windspeed data from galway and optionnaly from other selected stations in west ireland for comparative purposes.  
- [ ] **Data Preparation**  
    Handle datasets inconsistencies
- [ ] **Exploratory Data Analysis**  
    Visualize wind speed trends and patterns  
- [ ] **Modeling and Evaluation**  
    Estimate potential turbine power, analyze trends and predict future wind patterns.  
- [ ] **Documentation and Reporting**  
    Record findings, plots and interpretation.
