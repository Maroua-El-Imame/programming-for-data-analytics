# Programming For Data Analytics - Assignments sheet  

This repository is in allignment with the assignments proposed in the module of Programming For Data Analytics. 

It showcases my progressive learning based on the module’s lectures, demonstrates my ability to conduct independent research, interpret and apply relevant documentation and external resources.  

This repository contains 4 assignments, each covering different stages of data analysis process, including : retrieving, cleaning, analyzing and presenting data.

## Resources  

The following websites were primarily used to explore resources in order to complete the weekly tasks.  
More specific references are cited and included as comments in sections of code where it's relevant.  

[Python documentation](https://docs.python.org/3/)

## Environment Setup :

| Python in Git     |
|----------|

-Navigate to github  
-Click Sign up  
-Follow the prompts to create a personal account.  
***  
-Go to github.  
-Log in to your account.  
-Click the new repository button in the top-right **'+'** symbol   
-Follow [steps](https://docs.github.com/en/repositories/creating-and-managing-repositories/creating-a-new-repository)  
-Click create repository.  
***  
-On GitHub, navigate to the main page of the repository.  
-Under the repository name, select the code dropdown menu.  
-Click Create codespace on main.  
-From menu top left click on View > Explorer -  
-Under repository title (in bold) click on New file  
-Lower case file name, then add .ipynb extension ( for notebook format) or .py extension ( for python file).  
-Follow steps from developing a code to committing then lastly syncing changes.

| Python on Windows     |
|----------|

[Download cmder](https://cmder.app/)  
[Download notepad++](https://notepad-plus-plus.org/)  
[Download anaconda (python)](https://www.anaconda.com/download)   
[Download vs code](https://code.visualstudio.com/Download)  

*** 
-Open VS Code and select "File > New File",  
    Save the file as .py format (e.g., my_script.py).  
    Write a Python script in the file.  

-With Python file open in VS Code, launch the terminal (see vscode menu)  
    Navigate through the terminal until reaching the same directory where Python file is located.  
    Possible to use Cmder for running Python code (CAT). Same as in Vs code, navigate to the directory where the Python file is 
saved using the cd command.  

-Cmder is mainly for command-line usage, while VS Code is where would most of coding and debugging run.   

-Lastly, steps to [clone repository using command line](https://docs.github.com/en/repositoriescreating-and-managing-repositories/cloning-a-repository)  
    Clone allows to copy the repository from GitHub to the local machine  
    Changes can be pushed to the remote repository on GitHub and/or pulled from Github into the local machine.  

| Python in repository - File browsing & viewing     |
|----------|

-Access the repository: You're already viewing the main [repository](https://github.com/Maroua-El-Imame/programming-for-data-analytics/blob/main/assignments/README.md) page.  
-View python file types: .py or .ipynb .  
-Navigate folder using the file explorer on the left. 
-Click on ipynb files to see their content, code and code output.  
-Notebook ouputs display automatically if no installation is planned.
